# Calculator App

## An Interactive Calculator With Working Buttons

This project was built following the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com)
and works just like a real calculator.

Live preview [here](https://jongithub59.github.io/calculator/).

## Features:

* Looks like a calculator with all of its buttons
* Performs basic math equations
* Can calculate multiple equations in a row
* Calculates exponents
* Calculates decimals
* Can clear only one number or operator to correct a mistake

## Reflection:

* Learned to make a primitive grid using flexbox for the buttons
* Imported a font for the header and button faces
* Learned to use forEach() to create the same event listeners for every button at once
* Learned how to use if statements for more constrained conditions within functions
* Gained better understanding of the use of functions and parameters
